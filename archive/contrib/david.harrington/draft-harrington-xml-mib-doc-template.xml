  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README

  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in

      <t>This template is not meant to be a conclusive list of everything
      needed to write MIB module documents, but to summarize the often-needed
      basic features to get a document containing a MIB module started. An
      important purpose of the template is to aid authors in developing a
      document that is laid out in a manner consistent with other documents
      containing MIB modules. Documents submitted for advancement to the
      standards track typically require review by a MIB Doctor. This template
      standardizes the layout and naming of sections, includes the appropriate
      boilerplate text, and facilitates the development of tools to automate
      the checking of MIB module documents, to speed the WG and IESG review

      see http://xml.resource.org/authoring/README.html for 'rfc' option

      comments in the XML describe how to fill in each section of the
      template, and then XML2RFC will generate the actual internet-draft with
      your information. XML2RFC automatically handles much of the boilerplate,

      <t>[TODO] The narrative part MUST include an overview section that

    <!-- Design Principles  -->

    <!--
        <t>This section is here to remind authors of the Design Principles
         for MIB modules.</t>

        <t>To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
        practice, an explicit attempt should be made to keep this MIB module
        as simple as possible.  This can be accomplished by applying the
        following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:</t>
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
            as objects are needed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Require objects be essential for either fault or
            performance or configuration management.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
          </t>
          <t>
            Limit the total number of objects.
          </t>
          <t>
            Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
            this or other MIB modules. The complexity of deriving values
            should be done by the managament station, not the agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
            instrumented.  The guideline that has been followed in previous
            MIB modules is one counter per critical section per layer.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider the requirements of a small footprint system, such 
            as a set-top box as well as the expanded functionality beneficial 
            to a large foootprint system. To the degree possible, costs 
            associated with advanced functionality should be borne only 
            by the systems implementing such functionality, and the overhead 
            of advanced functionality should minimally impact systems which 
            do not implement the advanced functionality.</t>

    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>[TODO] The narrative part SHOULD include one or more sections to
      briefly describe the structure of the MIB modules defined in the
      specification.</t>

      <section title="Textual Conventions">
        <!--Generic and Common Textual Conventions can be found summarized at 
http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-common-tcs.html-->

        <t></t>
      </section>

      <section title="The [TODO] Subtree">
        <t>[TODO] copy this section for each subtree in the MIB module, and
        describe the purpose of the subtree. For example, the fooStats subtree
        provides information for identifying fault conditions and performance
        degradation of the foo functionality.</t>

    <section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">
      <t>[TODO]: The narrative part MUST include a section that specifies the
      relationship (if any) of the MIB modules contained in this document to
      other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB
      modules.</t>

      <t>[TODO] If the MIB modules defined by the specification import
      definitions from other MIB modules or are always implemented in
      conjunction with other MIB modules, then those facts must be noted in
      the narrataive section, as must any special interpretations of objects
      in other MIB modules. Note that citations may NOT be put into the MIB
      module portions of the document, but documents used for Imported items
      are Normative references, so the citations must exist in the narrative
      section of the document. For example, some modules are always
      implemented in conjunction with the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and are REQUIRED to
      document how certain objects in the IF-MIB are used. In addition,
      media-specific MIB modules that rely on the ifStackTable [RFC2863] and
      the ifInvStackTable [RFC2864] to maintain information regarding
      configuration and multiplexing of interface sublayers MUST contain a
      description of the layering model.</t>

      <t>Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable
      to an entity implementing this MIB. In particular, it is assumed that an
      entity implementing the SAMPLE-MIB module will also implement the
      'system' group of the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref> and the
      'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
        <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref>
        is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply
        to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification
        of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The
        SAMPLE-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Relationship to the IF-MIB">
        <t>[TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
        not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
        removed.</t>

        <t>The Interface MIB <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> requires that any
        MIB module which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific
        areas within the Interface MIB. These areas were intentionally left
        vague in the Interface MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby
        precluding management of certain media-types.</t>

        <t>Section 4 of <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> enumerates several
        areas which a media-specific MIB must clarify. The implementor is
        referred to <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> in order to understand the
        general intent of these areas.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MIB modules required for IMPORTS">
        <t>[TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
        module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
        REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace
        within the narrative sections. If there are imported items in the MIB
        module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already cited, they
        can be cited in text here. Since relationships to other MIB modules
        should be described in the narrative text, this section is typically
        used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are imported.</t>

      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writeable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unathorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to

      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
