Note that the main section ("Elements") of draft-reschke-xml2rfc-latest.xml is
auto-generated based on:

1) xml2rfcv2.rng (which in turn is derived from the DTD), and
2) draft-reschke-xml2rfc-latest.xml itself.

Within this section, <t> elements can be added to the element and attribute
descriptions and are supposed to round-trip through the re-generation
process.
