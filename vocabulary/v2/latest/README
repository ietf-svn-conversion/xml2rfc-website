Structure

Note that the main section ("Elements") of draft-reschke-xml2rfc-latest.xml is
auto-generated based on:

1) xml2rfcv2.rng (which in turn is derived from the DTD), and
2) draft-reschke-xml2rfc-latest.xml itself.

Within this section, <t> elements can be added to the element and attribute
descriptions and are supposed to round-trip through the re-generation
process.


Building

Building the spec requires:

1) java
2) tclsh (for xml2rfc.tcl)
3) an XSLT 1.0 processor that support exslt:node-set, such as xsltproc or Saxon 6.5.5 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/6.5.5/)

(the XSLT process currently is started by using whatever "saxon" does on the local system)
