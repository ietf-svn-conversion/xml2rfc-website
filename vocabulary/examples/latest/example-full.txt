Internet-Draft                 XML Example                September 2014


1.  Introduction

   This is this is the first paragraph of the introduction to this
   document.  This introduction is probably much shorter than it would
   be for a real Internet Draft.

   Something to note about this paragraph is that it has a pointer to
   Section 2, and one to Figure 1, both of which appear later in the
   document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Protocol Being Described

   This is a reference to [RFC6949].  Actually, the reference itself is
   not all that interesting, but the way that the reference is
   incorporated is.  Note that the inclusion of RFC 2119 was done at the
   top of the XML, while the information for RFC 6949 is done directly
   in the references section.

3.  Basic Lists

   Bulleted lists are good for items that are not ordered:

   o  This is the first item.

   o  This is the second item.  Here comes a sub-list:

      *  This is the first sub-item.

      *  This is the second sub-item

   o  This is the item after the sub-list.

   Numbered lists are good for items that are ordered:

   1.  This is the first item.

   2.  This is the second item.  Here comes a sub-list:

       1.  This is the first sub-item.

       2.  This is the second sub-item

   3.  This is the item after the sub-list.

4.  Figures

   The following is a figure with a caption.  Also, it uses the
   ampersand (&) and less than (<) characters in the example text.

      The ampersand (&) and
      the less than (<) are two characters
      that need escaping.

                       Figure 1: This could be haiku

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for an imaginary Internet Draft.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Some of the things included in this draft came from Elwyn Davies'
   templates.
