1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary.  The
   examples cover both version 2 [XML2RFCv2] and version 3 [XML2RFCv3].
   Some of the examples are given to help authors use parts of the
   vocabulary common to both versions (called "v2" and "v3" in this
   document), while others appear in order to help authors transitioning
   from version 2 to version 3 to see how features from the earlier
   version relate to features in the later version.

   This document currently only has one main example, which shows the
   commonly-used XML elements.  A future version of the document may
   have a complete example.

2.  Example of a v2 Document

   The following is a v2 document that has all the elements that are
   needed for typical Internet Drafts.



3.  Example of a v3 Document

   The following is a v3 document that has all the elements that are
   needed for typical Internet Drafts.  It was converted from the
   example in Section 2.
