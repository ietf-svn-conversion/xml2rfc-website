<abstract>

<t>This is an example of an abstract. It is a short paragraph that
gives an overview of the document in order to help the
reader determine whether or not they are interested in reading
further.</t>

</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>This is this is the first paragraph of the introduction to this
document. This introduction is probably much shorter than it would be
for a real Internet Draft.</t>

<t>Something to note about this paragraph is that it has a
pointer to <xref target="protocol"/>, and one to
<xref target="haiku"/>, both of which appear later in the
document.</t>

<!-- This is a comment. Comments in the XML do not appear in the
output formats. -->

<section title="Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="protocol" title="The Protocol Being Described">

<t>This is a reference to <xref target="RFC6949"/>.
Actually, the reference itself is not all that interesting, but the
way that the reference is incorporated is. Note that the inclusion of
RFC 2119 was done at the top of the XML, while the information for RFC
6949 is done directly in the references section.</t>

</section>

<section title="Basic Lists">

<t>Bulleted lists are good for items that
are not ordered:

<list style="symbols">

<t>This is the first item.</t>

<t>This is the second item. Here comes a sub-list:

<list style="symbols">

<t>This is the first sub-item.</t>

<t>This is the second sub-item</t>

</list></t>

<t>This is the item after the sub-list.</t>

</list>

</t>

<t>Numbered lists are good for items that are ordered:

<list style="numbers">

<t>This is the first item.</t>

<t>This is the second item. Here comes a sub-list:

<list style="numbers">

<t>This is the first sub-item.</t>

<t>This is the second sub-item</t>

</list></t>

<t>This is the item after the sub-list.</t>

</list>

</t>

</section>

<section title="Figures">

<t>The following is a figure with a caption.
Also, it uses the ampersand (&amp;) and less than
(&lt;) characters in the example text.</t>

<figure title="This could be haiku" anchor="haiku">
<artwork>
      The ampersand (&amp;) and
      the less than (&lt;) are two characters
      that need escaping. 
</artwork>
</figure>

</section>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>None.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>There are no security considerations for an imaginary
Internet Draft.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">

<t>Some of the things included in this draft came from
Elwyn Davies' templates.</t>
