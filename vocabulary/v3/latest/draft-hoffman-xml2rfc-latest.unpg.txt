1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocabulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The following is a hopefully-complete list of all the technical
   changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document.  Note that the list is
   for the current version of this document only.  There are additional
   changes that are expected to the v3 vocabulary that are being
   discussed.  Also note that changes to the design choices for the
   differences are also expected.

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      format for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually, but it
      is likely to be years away.

   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense
   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  However, the goal of starting and editing a v3
   document being easier than for a v2 document is more important than
   backwards compatibility with v2, given the latter two design
   criteria.

   The list of changes so far is:

   o  In <address>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.

   o  In <artwork> and <author>, added optional "xml:lang" attribute.

   o  Added the <b>, <i>, and <tt> elements.

   o  In <front>, made <date> optional.

   o  In <postal>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allowed the inclusion of <postalbody>.

   o  Added <postalbody>, free text that represents the address.

   o  In <section>, added the optional "numbered" and "removeinrfc"
      attributes.

   o  Removed the <spanx> element, and replaced it with <b>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  In <ttcol>, added <xref>, <eref>, <iref>, and <cref> as optional
      children.

1.1.1.  Design for Changes in List Handling

   This section describes one of the larger changes in the design of v3,
   namely the way lists are handled.  The community has asked for many
   changes to list handing to make creating and editing lists more
   intuitive.  The goals include:

   o  List items can have more than one paragraph without triggering
      another list label.

   o  Lists should be block elements, not inline (flow) elements.  They
      should be usable outside <t>.

   o  Give more control over the labels for "style" of "letters",
      "numbers", or "symbols".  Make more explicit the rules for nested
      lists that use the defaults for a "style".

   o  Make hanging lists more like other list styles.

   o  Make a real "dictionary" style, with the definition starting on a
      new line.

   o  Don't mix label style with content (the "format" attribute).

   o  Create a new mechanism to cause a paragraph to be indented,
      without using <list style="empty">.

   To meet these goals, the following changes have been made in the v3
   vocabulary:

   o  <list> is changed to have each list item is represented by a <li>
      element.  The content model for <li> is the same as that of
      <annotation> with the addition of <t>, namely: text, <b>, <cref>,
      <eref>, <i>, <iref>, <t>, <tt>, and <xref>.

   o  Inside of an <li> element, a <t> elements causes a break but
      without triggering another label.  The <li> element has optional
      attributes only where needed.

   o  <list> no longer needs to be inside of <t>, and can appear in the
      other contexts where a list might be expected.

   o  <list> has a new optional "anchor" attribute so that a list can be
      referenced from other places in the text.

   o  For the "style" attributes in <list>:

      *  For "letters", "numbers", and "symbols", there is an optional
         "format" attribute that matches the current one for formatting
         the label.  There will be a clear set of defaults for each of
         these given in the spec.

      *  For "hanging", the <li> element has an optional attribute of
         "hangText".

      *  Add a new style of "dictionary", the <li> element has an
         optional attribute of "definition".

   An example of using the new format for a simple bulleted list where
   the second item has two paragraphs is:

   <list style="symbols">
      <li>This is the first element with a bullet.</li>
      <li>This is the second element with a bullet.
         <t>This is part of the second element,
         but it does not have a bullet</t></li>
      <li>This is the third element with a bullet.</li>
   </list>

1.1.2.  Design for Changes in Reference Handling

   This section describes one of the larger changes in the design of v3,
   namely the additions to make using references easier.

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix B (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   [[anchor4: In the section below, some elements/attributes do not have
   a prose description yet.  This is because this is work-in-progress;
   feedback with accurate descriptions is appreciated.]]

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  The abstract ought to be
   self-contained and thus should not contain references or unexpanded
   abbreviations.  See Section 4.3 of [RFCSTYLE] for more information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.41)

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  <postal> elements (Section 2.30)

   o  <phone> elements (Section 2.29)

   o  <facsimile> elements (Section 2.17)

   o  <email> elements (Section 2.15)

   o  <uri> elements (Section 2.46)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.

   For instance:

   <annotation>
     Latest version available at <eref
     target='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml'/>.
   </annotation>

   ...will generate the text used in the reference for [XML].

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.34).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv".

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.  Note that RFCs occasionally are
   published with enhanced diagrams; a recent example is [RFC5598].

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.18).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file essentially is in-lined.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.

   The value either is a well-known keyword (such as "abnf"), or an
   Internet Media Type (see [RFC2046]).

   How it is used depends on context and application.  For instance, a
   formatter can attempt to syntax-highlight code in certain known
   languages.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.5.9.  'xml:space' attribute

   Determines whitespace handling.

   "preserve" is both the default value and the only meaningful setting
   anyway (because that's what the <artwork> element is for).

   See also Section 2.10 of [XML].

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see Section 4.12 of [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <organization> element (Section 2.28)

   2.  One optional <address> element (Section 2.2)

2.6.1.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.6.2.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

2.6.3.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.6.4.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.6.5.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.7.  <b>

   Causes the text to be displayed in a bold font.

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.9), <i> (Section 2.21), <li> (Section 2.24),
   <postamble> (Section 2.32), <preamble> (Section 2.33), <t>
   (Section 2.41), and <tt> (Section 2.44).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.8.  <back>

   Contains the "back" part of the document: the references and
   appendices.

   This element appears as child element of: <rfc> (Section 2.37).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  Optional <references> elements (Section 2.35)

   2.  Optional <section> elements (Section 2.38)

2.9.  <c>

   Provides the content of a cell in a table.

   This element appears as child element of: <texttable> (Section 2.42).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.10.  <city>

   Gives the city name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.11.  <code>

   Gives the postal region code.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.12.  <country>

   Gives the country in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.13.  <cref>

   Represents a comment.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work-in-progress.
   They usually appear either inline and visually highlighted, at the
   end of the document (depending on file format and settings of the
   formatter), or not at all (when generating an RFC).

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <i> (Section 2.21), <li>
   (Section 2.24), <postamble> (Section 2.32), <preamble>
   (Section 2.33), <t> (Section 2.41), <tt> (Section 2.44), and <ttcol>
   (Section 2.45).

   Content model: only text content.

2.13.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.  The processor will
   auto-generate an identifier when none is given.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.13.2.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.14.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see Section 8 of [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are
   left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system date
   if the attributes that are specified do match the system date.

   Note that month names need to match the full (English) month name
   ("January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December") in order
   for expiration calculations to work (some implementations might
   support additional formats, though).

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.14.1.  'day' attribute

   Day of publication.

2.14.2.  'month' attribute

   Month of publication.

2.14.3.  'year' attribute

   Year of publication.

2.15.  <email>

   Provides an email address.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "mailto"
   URI (so does not include the prefix "mailto:").  See Section 2 of
   [RFC6068] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.16.  <eref>

   Represents an "external" link (as specified in the "target"
   attribute).

   If the element has text content, that content will be used.
   Otherwise, the value of the target attribute will be inserted in
   angle brackets ([RFC3986], Appendix C).

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <i> (Section 2.21), <li>
   (Section 2.24), <postamble> (Section 2.32), <preamble>
   (Section 2.33), <t> (Section 2.41), <tt> (Section 2.44), and <ttcol>
   (Section 2.45).

   Content model: only text content.

2.16.1.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   URI of the link target (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]).

2.17.  <facsimile>

   Represents the phone number of a fax machine.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.18.  <figure>

   [[element.figure.missing: element description missing]]

   This element appears as child element of: <section> (Section 2.38),
   and <t> (Section 2.41).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  Optional <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   2.  One optional <preamble> element (Section 2.33)

   3.  One <artwork> element (Section 2.5)

   4.  One optional <postamble> element (Section 2.32)

2.18.1.  'align' attribute

   Used to change the alignment of <preamble> and <postamble>.

   Note: does not affect title or <artwork> alignment.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.18.2.  'alt' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.18.3.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this figure.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.18.4.  'height' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.18.5.  'src' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.18.6.  'suppress-title' attribute

   Figures that have an "anchor" attribute will automatically get an
   autogenerated title (such as "Figure 1").  Setting this attribute to
   "false" will prevent this.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.18.7.  'title' attribute

   [[element.figure.attribute.title.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

2.18.8.  'width' attribute

   Duplicates functionality available on <artwork>; avoid it.

2.19.  <format>

   Provides a link to an additional format variant for a reference.

   Note that these additional links are neither used in published RFCs,
   nor supported by all tools.  If the goal is to provide a single URI
   for a reference, the "target" attribute on <reference> can be used
   instead.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.34).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.19.1.  'octets' attribute

   Octet length of linked-to document.

   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <postamble> (Section 2.32),
   <preamble> (Section 2.33), <t> (Section 2.41), and <tt>
   (Section 2.44).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

2.22.  <iref>

   Provides terms for the document's index.

   Index entries can be either single items (when just the "item"
   attribute is given) or nested items (by specifying "subitem" as
   well).

   For instance:

   <iref item="Grammar" subitem="item"/>

   will produce an index entry for "Grammar, item".

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <figure> (Section 2.18), <i>
   (Section 2.21), <li> (Section 2.24), <postamble> (Section 2.32),
   <preamble> (Section 2.33), <section> (Section 2.38), <t>
   (Section 2.41), <tt> (Section 2.44), and <ttcol> (Section 2.45).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.22.1.  'item' attribute (mandatory)

   The item to include.

2.22.2.  'primary' attribute

   Setting this to "true" declares the occurrence as "primary", which
   might cause it to be highlighted in the index.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.22.3.  'subitem' attribute

   The subitem to include.

2.23.  <keyword>

   Specifies a keyword applicable to the document.

   Note that each element should only contain a single keyword; for
   multiple keywords, the element can simply be repeated.

   Keywords are used both in the RFC Index and in the metadata of
   generated document formats.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model: only text content.

2.24.  <li>

   Specifies an item in a list.  In an <li> item, a <t> item causes the
   item to have an additional paragraph without triggering another
   label.

   This element appears as child element of: <list> (Section 2.25).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <t> elements (Section 2.41)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

2.24.1.  'definition' attribute

   In a list whose style is "dictionary", the "definition" attribute of
   <li> gives the term being defined.  In a list whose style is not
   "dictionary", the processor will return an error.

2.24.2.  'hangtext' attribute

   In a list whose style is "hanging", the "hangText" attribute of <li>
   gives the term that will be at the left margin.  In a list whose
   style is not "hanging", the processor will return an error.

2.25.  <list>

   Delineates a text list.

   Each list item is represented by a <t> element.  The vocabulary
   currently does not directly support list items consisting of multiple
   paragraphs; if this is needed, <vspace> (Section 2.47) can be used as
   workaround.

   This element appears as child element of: <section> (Section 2.38),
   and <t> (Section 2.41).

   Content model:

   One or more <li> elements (Section 2.24)

2.25.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this list.

2.25.2.  'counter' attribute

   This attribute holds a token that serves as an identifier for a
   counter.  The intended use is continuation of lists.

   Note that this attribute functions only when the style attribute is
   using the "format..." syntax (Section 2.25.4); otherwise, it is
   ignored.

2.25.3.  'format' attribute

   The format for the labels in this list.  The "format" attribute only
   applies to lists whose "style" is "letters", "numbers", and
   "symbols".  If the "format" attribute is given for a list with any
   other "style", the processor will issue an error.

   The default format for "letters" is "%c".  The default format for
   "numbers" is "%d".  The default format for "symbols" is "o".
   [[anchor6: That last one is almost certainly wrong and this needs to
   be specified better in the style="format" part as well.]]

2.25.4.  'style' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the display of a list.

   The value of this attribute is inherited by any nested lists that do
   not have this attribute set.  It may be set to:

   "empty" (or not set)

      For unlabeled list items; it can also be used for indentation
      purposes (this is the default value).

   "hanging"

      For lists where the items are labeled with a piece of text.

   "letters"

      For ordered lists using letters as labels (lowercase letters
      followed by a period; after "z", it rolls over to a two-letter
      format).  For nested lists, processors usually flip between
      uppercase and lowercase.

   "numbers"

      For ordered lists using numbers as labels.

   "symbols"

      For unordered (bulleted) lists.

      The style of the bullets is chosen automatically be the processor
      (some implementations allow overriding the default using a
      processing instruction).

   And, finally:

   "format ..."

      For lists with customized labels, consisting of fixed text and an
      item counter in various formats.

      The value is a free-form text that allows counter values to be
      inserted using a "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]"
      generates labels of the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item
      number as decimal number.

      The following formats are supported:

      %c lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.)

      %C uppercase letters (A, B, C, etc.)

      %d decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)

      %i lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.)

      %I uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.)

      %% represents a percent sign

      Other formats are reserved for future use.

   This element appears as child element of: <rfc> (Section 2.37).

   Content model:

   One or more <section> elements (Section 2.38)

2.27.  <note>

   Creates an unnumbered section that appears after the abstract.

   It is usually used for additional information to reviewers (working
   group information, mailing list, ...), or for additional publication
   information such as "IESG Notes".

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.41)

2.27.1.  'title' attribute (mandatory)

   The title of the note.

2.28.  <organization>

   Specifies the affiliation of an author.

   This information appears in both the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page ([RFCSTYLE], Section 4.1.1).  If the value is long,
   an abbreviated variant can be specified in the "abbrev" attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model: only text content.

2.28.1.  'abbrev' attribute

   Abbreviated variant.

2.29.  <phone>

   Represents a phone number.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.30.  <postal>

   Contains optional child elements providing postal information.  These
   elements will be displayed in an order that is processor-specific.
   Thus, a postal address should probably contain only a set of
   <street>, <city>, <region>, <code>, and <country> elements, or only a
   single <postalbody> element, but not both.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  <street> elements (Section 2.40)

   o  <city> elements (Section 2.10)

   o  <region> elements (Section 2.36)

   o  <code> elements (Section 2.11)

2.31.  <postalbody>

   A method for presenting a postal address without using <street>,
   <city>, <region>, <code>, and <country> elements.  Processors will
   maintain horizontal whitespace and line breaks in the text of the
   <postalbody> element.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.32.  <postamble>

   Gives text that appears at the bottom of a figure or table.

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.18),
   and <texttable> (Section 2.42).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.33.  <preamble>

   Gives text that appears at the top of a figure or table.

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.18),
   and <texttable> (Section 2.42).

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.34.  <reference>

   Represents a bibliographical reference.

   This element appears as child element of: <references>
   (Section 2.35).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One <front> element (Section 2.20)

   2.  Optional <seriesInfo> elements (Section 2.39)

   3.  Optional <format> elements (Section 2.19)

   4.  Optional <annotation> elements (Section 2.3)

2.34.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the references section,
   and as an identifier in links to this reference entry.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.34.2.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.35.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative"; see item x
   of Section 4.8.5 of [RFCSTYLE]).  This vocabulary supports the split
   with the "title" attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.8).

   Content model:

   One or more <reference> elements (Section 2.34)

2.35.1.  'title' attribute

   Provides the title for the References section (defaulting to
   "References").

   In general, the title should be either "Normative References" or
   "Informative References".

2.36.  <region>

   Provides the region name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.37.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One <front> element (Section 2.20)

   2.  One <middle> element (Section 2.26)

   3.  One optional <back> element (Section 2.8)

2.37.1.  'category' attribute

   Allowed values:

   o  "no"

   o  "yes"

2.37.3.  'docName' attribute

   For Internet-Drafts, this specifies the draft name (which appears
   below the title).

   Note that the file extension is not part of the draft, so in general
   it should end with the current draft number ("-", plus two digits).

   Furthermore, it is good practice to disambiguate current editor
   copies from submitted drafts (for instance, by replacing the draft
   number with the string "latest").

   See Section 7 of [IDGUIDE] for further information.

2.37.4.  'ipr' attribute

   Represents the Intellectual Property status of the document.  See
   Appendix A.2 for details.

   number within that series.

2.37.9.  'submissionType' attribute

   The document stream.

   See Section 2 of [RFC5741] for details.

   Allowed values:

   o  "IETF" (default)

   o  "IAB"

2.37.11.  'xml:lang' attribute

   The natural language used in the document (defaults to "en").

   See Section 2.12 of [XML] for more information.

2.38.  <section>

   Represents a section (when inside a <middle> element) or an appendix
   (when inside a <back> element).

   Sub-sections are created by nesting <section> elements inside
   <section> elements.

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.8),
   <middle> (Section 2.26), and <section> (Section 2.38).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  In any order:

2.38.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.38.2.  'numbered' attribute

   If set to "no", this section does not get a section number.
   Processors will verify that such a section is not followed by a
   numbered section in a part, and will verify that the section is a
   top-level section.

   Allowed values:

   o  "yes" (default)

   o  "no"

2.38.3.  'removeinrfc' attribute

   If set to "yes", this section is marked in the processor with text
   indicating that it should be removed before the document is published
   as an RFC.

   o  "exclude"

   o  "default" (default)

2.39.  <seriesInfo>

   Specifies the document series in which this document appears, and
   also specifies an identifier within that series.

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.34).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.39.1.  'name' attribute (mandatory)

   The name of the series.

   The following names trigger specific processing (such as for auto-
   generating links, and adding descriptions such as "work in
   progress"): "BCP", "FYI", "Internet-Draft", "RFC", and "STD".

2.39.2.  'value' attribute (mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).

2.40.  <street>

   Provides a street address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

2.42.  <texttable>

   Contains a table, consisting of an optional preamble, a header line,
   rows, and an optional postamble.

   The number of columns in the table is determined by the number of
   <ttcol> elements.  The number of rows in the table is determined by
   the number of <c> elements divided by the number of columns.  There
   is no requirement that the number of <c> elements be evenly divisible

   Allowed values:

   o  "left"

   o  "center" (default)

   o  "right"

2.42.2.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.

   The value needs to be a valid XML "Name" (Section 2.3 of [XML]).

2.42.3.  'style' attribute

   [[element.texttable.attribute.style.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

   Allowed values:

   o  "all"

   o  "none"

   o  "headers"

   o  "full" (default)

2.42.4.  'suppress-title' attribute

   [[element.texttable.attribute.suppress-title.missing: attribute
   description missing]]

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.42.5.  'title' attribute

   [[element.texttable.attribute.title.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

2.43.  <title>

   Represents the document title.

   When this element appears in the <front> element of the current
   document, the title might also appear in page headers or footers.  If
   it's long (~40 characters), the "abbrev" attribute is used to
   specified an abbreviated variant.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model: only text content.

2.43.1.  'abbrev' attribute

   Specifies an abbreviated variant of the document title.

2.44.  <tt>

   Causes the text to be displayed in a constant-width font.

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <i> (Section 2.21), <li>
   (Section 2.24), <postamble> (Section 2.32), <preamble>
   (Section 2.33), and <t> (Section 2.41).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.21)

2.45.  <ttcol>

   Contains a column heading in a table.

   This element appears as child element of: <texttable> (Section 2.42).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.49)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  Text

2.45.1.  'align' attribute

   Determines the horizontal alignment within the table column.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.45.2.  'width' attribute

   [[element.ttcol.attribute.width.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

2.46.  <uri>

   Contains a web address associated with the author.

   The contents should be a valid URI (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]).

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.47.  <vspace>

   This element can be used to force the inclusion of a single line
   break or multiple blank lines.

   Note that this is a purely presentational element and thus its use
   ought to be avoided.

   This element appears as child element of: <t> (Section 2.41).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.47.1.  'blankLines' attribute

   Number of blank lines to be inserted, where "0" indicates a single
   line break (defaults to "0").

   For paged output formats, no additional blank lines should be
   generated after a page break.

2.48.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group the document
   originates from, if any.  The recommended format is the official name
   of the Working Group (with some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.37.9).

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.20).

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part.

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand
   what is being referred to.

   [[anchor8: This needs to be expanded with examples and with a
   discussion how the autogenerated text differs when <xref> is not
   empty]]

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <b> (Section 2.7), <c> (Section 2.9), <i> (Section 2.21), <li>
   (Section 2.24), <postamble> (Section 2.32), <preamble>
   (Section 2.33), <t> (Section 2.41), <tt> (Section 2.44), and <ttcol>
   (Section 2.45).

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.1.  'format' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the format of the generated
   reference text.

   "counter"

      Inserts a counter, such as the number of a section, figure, or
      table.

   "default"

      Inserts a text fragment that describes the referenced part
      completely, such as "Section 2", "Table 4", or "[XML]".

   "none"

      There will be no auto-generated text.

   "title"

      Inserts a title for the referenced element (usually obtained from
      the referenced element's "title" attribute; some processors also
      use the <title> child element or a <reference> target).

   Allowed values:

   o  "counter"

   o  "title"

   o  "none"

   o  "default" (default)

2.49.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Unused.

   It's unclear what the purpose of this attribute is; processors seem
   to ignore it and it never was documented.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.49.3.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.

   The value needs to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of
   another element in the document.

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   [[anchor9: Explain those code points where the processors implement
   something special, such as "nbsp".]]

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII
   [USASCII] characters ([RFC2223], Section 3).  Future versions are
   likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the vocabulary
   will be extended so that US-ACSII alternatives can be provided when
   that makes sense (for instance, in contact information).

5.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor10: This section is likely incomplete.]]

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document serves as the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml".  The following is to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
      Authors Section.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  N/A

   Author:  See Authors Section.

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for - surprise - "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | TLP      | starting with publication date |
   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | [TLP3.0] | 2009-11-01                     |
   | [TLP4.0] | 2010-04-01                     |
   +----------+--------------------------------+

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
      the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November
      10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in some of this
      material may not have granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
      modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
      Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s)
      controlling the copyright in such materials, this document may not
      be modified outside the IETF Standards Process, and derivative
      works of it may not be created outside the IETF Standards Process,
      except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate it
      into languages other than English.

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      Note: this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status Of This Memo".

A.2.2.  Historic Values

A.2.2.1.  Historic Values: '*trust200811'

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811" and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in <http://
   trustee.ietf.org/license-info/archive/
   IETF-Trust-License-Policy_11-10-08.pdf>.

A.2.2.2.  Historic Values: '*3978'

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.
