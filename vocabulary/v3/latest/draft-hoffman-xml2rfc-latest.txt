                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                      draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.  This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC
   2629 and its expected followup, draft-reschke-xml2rfc.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocabulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible. [[anchor2: More needs
   to be said here about what "obsoletes" means in this case.]]

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series described in
   [RFC6949].  The new format will be handled by one or more new
   processors for checking the XML and converting it to other
   representations.  Features of the expected processors are described
   in Appendix B.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating of the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

   In this document, the term "format" is used when describing types of
   documents, primarily XML and HTML.  The term "representation" is used
   when talking about a specific instatiation of a format, such as an
   XML document or an HTML document that was created by an XML document.

   The following two sections are a hopefully-complete list of all the
   technical changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document, as well as
   the design criteria for those changes.

1.1.  Design Criteria for the Changes in v3

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      representation for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually,
      but it is likely to be years away.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                      July 2014


   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense
   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant
   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   listed in Section 1.2.3, and are described in [XML2RFCv2].

1.2.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The format changes in v3 are listed in the following subsections.

1.2.1.  New Elements in v3

   o  Add <dl>, <ul>, and <ol> as new ways to make lists.  This is a
      significant change from v2 in that the child under these elements
      is <li>, not <t>. <li> has a model of either containing one or
      more <t> elements, or containing the flowing text normally found
      in <t>.

   o  Add <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <tt>, <sub>, and <sup> for character
      formatting.

   o  Add <aside> for incidental text that will be indented when
      displayed.

   o  Add <sourcecode> to differentiate from <artwork>.

   o  Add <blockquote> to indicate a quotation as in a paragraph-like
      format.

   o  Add <name> to sections, notes, figures, and texttables to allow
      character formatting (fixed-width font) in their titles, and to
      allow references.

   o  Add <postalLine>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

   o  Add <displayreference> to allow display of more mneumonic anchor
      names for automatically-included references.

   o  Add <refcontent> to allow better control of text in a reference.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                      July 2014


   o  Add <link> to point to a resource related to the RFC.

1.2.2.  New Attributes for Existing Elements

   o  Add "sortRefs", "symRefs", "tocDepth", and "tocInclude" attributes
      to <rfc> to cover processor instructions (PIs) that were in v2
      that are still needed in the grammar.

   o  Add "ascii" attributes to <author>, <email>, <organization>,
      <street>, <city>, <region> and <code>.  This allows an author to
      specify their information in their native scripts as the primary
      entry and still allow the ASCII-equivalent values to appear in the
      processed documents.

   o  Add "xml:lang" attribute to <artwork>, <postal>, and <author>.
      This is sometimes useful for renderers which display different
      fonts for ideographic characters used in China and Japan.

   o  Add the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Add the "numbered" and "removeinrfc" attributes to <section>.

   o  Add "autogeneratedBoilerplateText", "autogeneratedFigureNumber",
      "autogeneratedParagraphNumber", "autogeneratedSectionNumber", and
      "autogeneratedTableNumber" attributes to <rfc>, <figure>, <t>,
      <section>, and <texttable>, respectively.

1.2.3.  Elements and Attributes Deprecated from v2

   Deprecated elements and attributes are legacy vocabulary from v2 that
   are supported for input to v3 processors.  They are likely to be
   removed from those processors in the future.  Instead of being listed
   in Section 2, they are listed in in Section 3.  See Appendix B for
   more information on processors and how they will handle deprecated
   features.

   o  Deprecate <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  Deprecate <spanx>; replace it with <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  Deprecate <vspace> because the major use for it, creating pseudo-
      paragraph-breaks in lists, is now handled properly.

   o  Deprecate <facsimile> because it is rarely used and is not
      actually useful; <email> is a much more useful way to get in touch
      with authors.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                      July 2014


   o  Deprecate <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.  If the goal is to provide a
      single URI for a reference, use the "target" attribute on
      <reference> instead.

   o  Deprecate the "title" attribute in <section>, <note>, <figure>,
      and <texttable> in favor of the new <name>.

   o  Deprecate the "alt", and "src" attributes in <figure> because they
      overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

   o  Deprecate the "xml:space" attribute in <artwork> because there was
      only one useful value.  Deprecate "height" and "width" attribute
      in both <artwork> and <figure> because they are not needed for the
      new output formats.

   o  Deprecate the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecate the "none" and "title" values for the "format"
      attribute in <xref> because the former makes no sense semantically
      and the latter because it has unpredictable output.

1.2.4.  Additional Changes from v2

   o  Allow non-ASCII characters in the format; the characters that are
      actually allowed will be determined by the RFC Editor.

   o  Allow <artwork> to be used on its own in <section> (no longer
      confine it to a figure).

   o  Give more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  In <address>, allow the sub-elements to be in any order.

   o  Allow <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <tt>, <eref>, and <xref> in

   o  Do not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead get it

1.3.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix E (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, the
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]).  In short, it is a text string with no spaces
   or colons; hyphens and underscores are allowed.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  See [RFCSTYLE] for more
   information on restrictions for the abstract.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.26).

2.3.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the annotation.

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area to which this document
   relates (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>.
   The list at the time that this document is being published is:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv".

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing, using a URI.  In

   this case, the textual content acts as fallback for output
   representations that do not support graphics, and thus ought to
   contain either a "line art" variant of the graphics, or otherwise
   prose that describes the included image in sufficient detail.

   If the artwork includes either "&" or "<" characters, or the string
   "]]>" those characters need to be encoded using escaping or CDATA
   block(s); see <sourcecode> for a fuller description of these
   solutions.

   In [XML2RFCv2], the <artwork> element was also used for source code
   and formal languages; in v3, this is now done with <sourcecode>.

   There are at least four ways to include SVG in artwork in Internet
   Drafts:

   o  Inline, by including all of the SVG in the content of the element
      (such as "<artwork type="svg"><svg xmlns...">")

   o  Inline, but using XInclude (see Appendix B.1 (such as "<artwork
      type="svg"><xi:include href=...")

   o  As a data: URI (such as "<artwork type="svg" src="data:image/
      svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3...">")

   o  As a URI to an external entity (such as "<artwork type="svg"
      src="http://www.example.com/...">")

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).
   This is only used with artwork that is text-based; when the art comes
   from the "src" attribute, the alternative text comes from the text of
   the artwork itself.

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the artwork).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]).

   [[anchor7: Add an example of in-lined SVG here.]]

   [[anchor8: Maybe include microlanguages for packets and call
   sequences if people want to create them.]]

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B) might add type-specific
   formatting to artwork with the preferred values.  If a processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning but should still use the artwork as if
   it had no "type" attribute.

   The preferred values for <artwork> types are:

   o  ascii-art

   o  call-flow

   o  hex-dump

   o  svg

   The RFC Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for ideographic
   characters used in China and Japan.

2.5.9.  'xml:space' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <aside>

   This element is a container for content that is semantically less
   important or tangential to the content that surrounds it.  The
   elements inside this container are indented from both margins when
   displayed.

   This element appears as child element of: <section> (Section 2.47).

   o  <texttable> elements (Section 2.55)

2.7.  <author>

   Provides information about a document's author.  This is used both
   for the document itself (at the beginning of the document) and for
   referenced documents (inside of <reference>).

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's full name.

2.7.2.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.7.3.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   The value contains one or more initials, each followed by a period.

2.7.5.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.7.6.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.8.  <b>

   Causes the text to be displayed in bold.  It is almost always a
   better idea to use the <strong> element instead.  This element can be

   date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When one or more of "year", "month", or "day"
   are left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system
   date if the attributes that are present are consisten with that date.

   full English month name: "January", "February", "March", "April",
   "May, "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November",

2.19.  <displayreference>

   This element gives a mapping between the anchor of a reference and a
   name that will be displayed instead.  This allows authors to display
   more mneumonic anchor names for automatically-included references.
   For example, if the reference uses the anchor "RFC6949", the
   following would cause that anchor in the body of displayed documents
   to be "RFC-dev":

   <displayreference from="RFC6449" to="RFC-dev"/>

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.9).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.19.1.  'from' attribute (mandatory)

   This attribute must be the name of an anchor in a <reference>
   element.

2.24.  <eref>

   Represents an "external" link (as specified in the "target"
   attribute).  This can be used for creating linked references, such as
   in HTML output.

   If the element has text content, that content will be used.
   Otherwise, the value of the target attribute will be inserted in
   angle brackets ([RFC3986], Appendix C).

2.25.2.  'alt' attribute

   Deprecated.  If the goal is to provide a single URI for a reference,
   use the "target" attribute on <reference> instead.

2.25.3.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this figure.

   Furthermore, the presence of this attribute causes the figure to be
   numbered.

2.25.4.  'autogeneratedFigureNumber' attribute

   The number for this figure, if one is generated by the processor.
   This attribute and its value are automatically generated by the RFC
   Processor, and are ignored by other processors.  If the value already

2.34.1.  'title' attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.35.  <ol>

   An ordered list.  The labels on the items will be either a number or
   a letter, depending on the value of the style attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <dd> (Section 2.18), <li>
   (Section 2.30), and <t> (Section 2.54).

   Content model:

2.35.3.  'start' attribute

   The ordinal value to start the list at.  This defaults to "1", and
   must be an integer of 0 or greater.

2.35.4.  'style' attribute

   The style of the labels on list items.  If the length of the style
   value is 1, the meaning is the same as it is for HTML:

   a  Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   A  Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   1  Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   i  Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   I  Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   For style "a" and "A", after the 26th entry, the numbering starts at
   "aa"/"AA", then "ab"/"AB", and so on.

   If the length of the style value is greater than 1, the value must
   contain a percent-encoded indicator and other text.  The value is a
   free-form text that allows counter values to be inserted using a
   "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]" generates labels of
   the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item number as decimal
   number.

   The following formats are supported:

   %c Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   %C Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   %d Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   %i Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   %I Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

2.36.  <organization>

   Specifies the affiliation of an author.

   This information appears in both the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page (see [RFCSTYLE] for more information).  If the
   value is long, an abbreviated variant can be specified in the
   "abbrev" attribute.

2.43.1.  'anchor' attribute (mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the references section,
   and as an identifier in links to this reference entry.

2.43.2.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.44.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative" as described
   in [RFCSTYLE]).  This vocabulary supports the split with the "title"
   attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.9).

   Content model:

   One or more <reference> elements (Section 2.43)

2.44.1.  'title' attribute

   Provides the title for the References section (defaulting to
   "References").

   In general, the title should be either "Normative References" or
   "Informative References".

2.45.  <region>

   Provides the region name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.38).

   Content model: only text content.

2.45.1.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the region name.

2.46.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <link> element (Section 2.31)

   2.  One <front> element (Section 2.26)

   3.  One <middle> element (Section 2.32)

   4.  One optional <back> element (Section 2.9)

2.46.1.  'autogeneratedBoilerplateText' attribute

   The full boilerplate text for this document.  This attribute and its
   value are automatically generated by the RFC Processor, and are
   ignored by other processors.  If the value already exists when the
   RFC Processor is run, it is replaced.

2.46.2.  'category' attribute

   Document category (see Appendix A.1).

   Allowed values:

   o  "std"

   o  "bcp"

   o  "info"

   o  "exp"

2.46.3.  'consensus' attribute

   Affects the generated boilerplate.

   See [RFC5741] for more information.

   Allowed values:

   o  "no"

   o  "yes"

2.46.4.  'docName' attribute

   Specifies the name or the Internet Draft or private document.  A
   private document is one whose representation is not meant to be an
   Internet Draft or RFC.  If the value for this attribute starts with
   the string "draft-", a processor treats the input as an Internet
   Draft; if the value starts with any other string, a processor treats
   this as a private document.  The name in the value should be the
   document name without any file extension.  That is, the value for
   this attribute should be "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07", not
   "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07.txt".

   A processor should give an error if both the "docName" and "number"
   attributes are given in the <rfc> element.

2.46.5.  'ipr' attribute

   Represents the Intellectual Property status of the document.  See
   Appendix A.2 for details.

   Allowed values:

   o  "full2026"

   o  "noDerivativeWorks2026"

   o  "none"

2.46.6.  'iprExtract' attribute

   Identifies a single section within the document for which extraction
   "as-is" is explicitly allowed (only relevant for historic values of
   the "ipr" attribute).

2.46.7.  'number' attribute

   The number of the RFC to be produced by a processor.

   A processor should give an error if both the "docName" and "number"
   attributes are given in the <rfc> element.

2.46.8.  'obsoletes' attribute

   A comma-separated list of RFC numbers or Internet-Draft names.

   Processors ought to parse the attribute value, so that incorrect
   references can be detected and, depending on output representation,
   hyperlinks can be generated.  Also, the value ought to be reformatted
   to insert whitespace after each comma if not already present.

   Allowed values:

   o  "IETF" (default)

   o  "IAB"

   o  "IRTF"

   (such as "[RFC2119]").  If the value for this is "no", the references
   come out as numbers (such as "[3]").

   Allowed values:

   o  "yes" (default)

2.47.  <section>

   Represents a section (when inside a <middle> element) or an appendix

   This attribute and its value are automatically generated by the RFC
   Processor, and are ignored by other processors.  If the value already
   exists when the RFC Processor is run, it is replaced.

2.47.3.  'numbered' attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.47.6.  'toc' attribute

   Indicates to a processor whether or not the section is to be included
   in the table of contents.  This only takes effect if the level of the
   section would have appeared in the table of contents based on the
   "tocDepth" attribute of the <rfc> element, and of course only if the
   table of contents is being created based on the "tocInclude"
   attribute of the <rfc> element.  If this is set to "exclude", any
   section below this one will be excluded as well.  The "default" value
   indicates to include the section if it would be included by the
   tocDepth attribute of the <rfc> element.

   Allowed values:

2.48.4.  'value' attribute (mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).

2.49.  <sourcecode>

   This element allows the inclusion of sourcecode into the document.

   <sourcecode> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks.  It is thus useful for source code and formal languages (such
   as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this document).

   For artwork such as character-based art, diagrams of message layouts,
   and so on, use the <artwork> element instead.

   A common problem authors have with <sourcecode> is that the XML
   processor returns errors if the text in the artwork contains either
   the "&" or "<" character, or the string "]]>".  To avoid these
   problems, the "&" and "<" characters may be escaped using the strings
   "&amp;" and "&lt;", respectively; the "]]>" string can be represented
   as "]]&gt;".  Alternatively, they may be surrounded in a CDATA
   structure: "<![CDATA[]]>".  For example:

   Desired output:
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"

   Using escaping:
   <sourcecode>
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&amp;" | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | "|"
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA:
   <sourcecode>
   <![CDATA[   allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"]]>
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA is not a panacea, but it does help prevent having to use
   escapes in places where using using escapes can cause other problems,
   such as difficulty of inclusion from other documents.

   This element appears as child element of: <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <blockquote> (Section 2.11), <dd> (Section 2.18), <figure>

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.1.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).  This attribute generally isn't used for document
   generation, but it can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as
   automated syntax checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.49.2.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the sourcecode.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A private
   processor (as described in Appendix B) might add type-specific
   formatting to sourcecode with the preferred values.  If a processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning but should still use the artwork as if
   it had no "type" attribute.

   The preferred values for <sourcecode> types are:

   Content model: only text content.

2.62.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part. [[anchor11: Need to
   say more about the processor output if the element is empty and if it
   has text.]]

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand
   what is being referred to.

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

3.5.  <vspace>

   Deprecated.  In earlier versions of this format, <vspace> was often
   used to get an extra blank line in a list element; in the v3
   vocabulary, that can be done instead by using multiple <t> elements
   inside the <li> element.  Other uses have no direct replacement.

   This element appears as child element of: <t> (Section 2.54).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

3.5.1.  'blankLines' attribute

   Deprecated.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.
   The RFC Editor may restrict some of the characters that can be used
   in a particular RFC; the rules for such restrictions are covered in
   [[anchor13: some other document to be named later when it is
   stable]].

5.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   The "type" attribute of the <artwork> and <sourcecode> elements is
   meant to encourage processors to automatically extract known types of
   content from an RFC or Internet Draft.  While extraction is probably
   safe, those processors might also think that they could further
   process the extracted content such as by rendering artwork or
   executing code.  Doing so without first sanity-checking the extracted
   content is clearly a terrible idea from a security perspective.  More
   generally, a processor that is reading RFCs or Internet Drafts needs
   to be suspicious of any content that it intends to post-process.

   All security considerations related to XML processing are relevant as
   well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [XML2RFCv2].  The following is
   to be registered with IANA.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                      July 2014


   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that transform
      xml2rfc to output representations such as plain text or HTML, plus
      additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be used as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml or .rfcxml when disambiguation from other
         XML files is needed

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
      Authors Section.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Author:  See Authors Section.

   Change controller:  RFC Series Editor (rse@rfc-editor.org)

6.2.  Link Relation Registration

   The following is a proposed addition to [LINKRELATIONS].

   Relation Name: convertedFrom

   Description: The document linked to was later converted to the
   document that contains this link relation.  For example, an RFC can
   have a link to the Internet Draft that became the RFC; in that case,
   the link relation would be "convertedFrom".

   Reference: This document.

   Notes: This relation is different than "predecessor-version" in that
   "predecessor-version" is for items in a version control system.  It
   is also different that "previous" in that this relation is used for
   converted resources, not those that are part of a sequence of
   resources.

   Application Data: none

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

Appendix B.  The v3 Format and Processors

   This section describes topics that are specific to processors.  Note
   that there is some discussion of processors in the main body of the
   document as well.  For example, some elements have descriptions of
   how a processor might create output from the element.

   A processor has multiple roles.  The processor checks whether or not
   the input is valid XML; it also checks whether or not the input XML
   matches this format.  It may have one or more outputs, depending on
   the way that it is invoked.  It might convert the XML to different
   XML, or to a different representation such as HTML or plain text, or
   do no conversion at all.  It also might give diagnostic warnings
   about how to improve the input.

   In v2, the grammar was specified as a DTD.  In v3, the grammar is
   specified only as Relax Next Generation (RNG).  This means that
   processors need to work from the RNG, not from a DTD.  Some of the
   features of the v3 grammar cannot be specified as a DTD.

   This section differentiates between three types of processors:

   o  RFC Processor -- The processor used by the RFC Editor to process
      the input from one of the RFC streams, and to process XML produced
      during the RFC editing process.

   o  Draft Processor -- The processor used by the Internet Draft
      submission tool.

   o  Private Processors -- There may be processors that are meant to
      run on the computers of authors.  These processors may be used to
      produce interim versions of the non-canonical representations so
      that authors can see how their XML might later be rendered; to
      create documents in representations different than those supported
      by the RFC Editor; to possibly create documents that are not meant
      to be Internet Drafts or RFCs; and to convert XML that has
      external information into XML that has that external information
      included.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                      July 2014


   It is expected that a single piece of software will be used for both
   the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor, with different application
   settings to differentiate between them.  It is also expected that the
   same software could be used as a Private Processor; others might
   create Private Processors independently, or using parts of, the
   software used by the RFC Editor.

   The RFC Processor and Draft Processor must have clear error
   reporting, giving more context than just a line number.  For example,
   the error messages will differentiate between errors in XML and those
   from the v3 format.

   It is expected that both the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor
   will have options to produce different types of output.  For example,
   they might have a "convert XML to XML" option that expands the XML
   entities in the output.

B.1.  Including External Text

   All XML processors for v3 are expected to support XInclude
   [XInclude].  XInclude specifies a processing model and syntax for
   general purpose inclusion of information that is either on the
   Internet or local to the user's computer.

   In the v3 syntax, XInclude is expressed as the <xi:include> element.
   To use this element, you need to include the "xi" namespace in the
   <rfc> element; that is, you need to specify

   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

   as one of the attributes in the <rfc> element.

   The most common way to use <xi:include> is to pull in references that
   are already formed as XML.  Currently, this can be done from
   xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org, but later is expected to be from the RFC
   Editor.  For example, if a document has three normative references,
   all RFCs, the document might contain:

   <references>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.2119.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.4869.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.7169.xml"/>
   </references>

   <xi:include> can be used anywhere an XML element could be used (but

   not where free text is used).  For example, if three Internet Drafts
   are all including a particular paragraph or section verbatim, that
   text can be kept either in a file or somewhere on the web, and be
   included with <xi:include>.  An example of pulling something from the
   local disk would be:

   <x:include href="file://home/chris/ietf/drafts/commontext.xml"/>

   In general, XInclude should be used instead of ENTITY references and
   XML Processor Instructions (PIs) that allow external inclusions.

   replace src= for artwork or sourcecode.]]

Appendix C.  Format and Content of RFCs (Future)

   [[[ This section describes the format of RFCs in the future.  The
   section is in this document only temporarily: it soon move to its own
   page on the RFC Editor's web site. ]]]

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series format
   described in [RFC6949].  RFCs will have multiple representations: the
   canonical document will be in XML using the v3 format, and many non-
   canonical representations (such as HTML and text) will be generated
   as well.

C.1.  Canonical RFCs

   The canonical RFCs will not have any markup that uses a deprecated
   feature.  The processor described in Appendix B will have a "convert
   with warnings" mode that will convert a v2 XML document to a v3 XML
   document that converts deprecated features wherever possible, issuing
   warnings for where it cannot convert.  The processor will also have a
   "strict" mode that will issue errors if any deprecated features are
   in the input.

   The canonical format for RFCs have a number of restrictions that the
   RFC Processor needs to enforce before a document can be published in
   its final form.  In this "final" mode, the processor will give a hard
   error when an input XML file has:

   o  any element or attribute listed as "deprecated" in the v3
      vocabulary

   o  XML comments

   o  XML Processor Instructions

   o  an external DTD

   o  ENTITYs that have a SYSTEM component

   o  <artwork> elements with a "src" attribute that points to a URI
      with a scheme other than "data:"

   o  <cref> elements

   The RFC Processor will have a mode that gives hard errors on all of
   the above other than <cref> elements.  This exception is to allow the
   RPC to insert <cref> elements in the working XML for notes to authors
   in AUTH 48, notes to IANA, and so on.

   The RFC Processor will also generate values for the
   "autogeneratedBoilerplateText" attribute in <rfc>, and
   "autogeneratedSectionNumber", "autogeneratedFigureNumber", and
   "autogeneratedTableNumber" attributes in <section>, <figure>, and
   <texttable> elements, respectively.  These will be filled in by the
   RFC processor so that the canonical XML file has all of the same
   information as the non-canonical representations.

C.2.  Non-canonical RFC Representations

   As described in [RFC6949], the RFC Editor will publish non-canonical
   representations of RFCs.  Those non-canonical representations will be
   derived from the canonical XML.  The generation of these non-
   canonical representations means that there will be much more emphasis
   put on the RFC Processor.

   [[[ Stuff will go on the web page about each non-canonical
   representation. ]]]

Appendix D.  Format and Content of Internet Drafts (Future)

   [[[ This section describes a future where the v3 format will be
   allowed as the input for Internet Draft publication.  The section is
   in this document only temporarily: it will soon move to its own page
   managed by someone yet to be determined. ]]]

   [[[ Description of the transition from the current text format to
   also allowing v3 XML. ]]]

   [[[ Description of what will and won't be allowed in input XML. ]]]

D.1.  The Draft Processor

   The Draft Processor will handle input differently than the RFC
   Processor.  For example, some XML that is valid for Internet Drafts
   will not be valid for canonical RFCs, so the Draft Processor can be
   set to give warnings for those features but the RFC Processor can be
   set to give hard errors.

   The Draft Processor will help in the transition from the v2 format to
   the v3 format.  A user could request that the Draft Processor convert
   a v2 document to v3, using the new features of v3 where appropriate,
   and removing the parts that are no longer supported.  The processor
   might be able to fully convert a v2 document to v3, or it might have
   to only give advice on some of the v2 features that could not be
   automatically converted.

   The Draft Processor should have a mode that mimics the RFC
   Processor's restictive mode, but that instead gives warnings instead
   of hard errors.  The Draft Processor should also produce interim
   versions of the non-canonical representations so that authors can see
   how their XML might later be rendered; and to convert documents that
   use the v2 format to v3.

D.2.  Processor Instructions

   In the v2 format, XML PIs were used for a wide variety of tasks,
   including changing some formatting of the text outputs, adding
   information to HTML versions of Internet Drafts, and specifying other
   instructions to processors.  In the v3 format, a much smaller set of
   PIs is supported for the Draft Processor and Private Processors.  It
   is important to note that canonical RFCs will not contain any PIs.

   The following PIs will be supported by the Draft Processor:

   o  editing -- When set to "yes", causes the processor to insert
      reference numbers throughout the output files to allow ease of
      referral to particular paragraphs or artwork in the text.  The
      default is "no".

   The following PIs will not be supported by the Draft Processor, but
   are included so that Private Processors have a common way of
   referring to them:

   o  comments -- When set to "yes", causes all <cref> elements to be
      rendered in the output files.  The default is "yes".

   o  linefile -- Causes the processor to emit more detailed information
      about which line of which input file caused an error or warning.

   Note that a Private Processor can have PIs not from this list.
