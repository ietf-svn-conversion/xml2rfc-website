                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                      draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion

1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocablulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The following is a hopefully-complete list of all the technical
   changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document.

   o  Added the <const> element.

   o  Added the <em> element.

   o  Added the <em> element.

   o  In <section>, added the optional "numbered" attribute.

   o  Removed the <spanx> element, and replaced it with <const>, <em>,
      and <em>,

   o  In <ttcol>, added <xref>, <eref>, <iref>, and <cref> as optional
      children.

   o  [[ MORE WILL GO HERE ]]

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix B (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   [[anchor2: In the section below, some elements/attributes do not have
   a prose description yet.  This is because this is work-in-progress;
   feedback with accurate descriptions is appreciated.]]

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  The abstract ought to be
   self-contained and thus should not contain references or unexpanded
   abbreviations.  See Section 4.3 of [RFCSTYLE] for more information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.21).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.40)

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <postal> element (Section 2.30)

   2.  One optional <phone> element (Section 2.29)

   3.  One optional <facsimile> element (Section 2.18)

   4.  One optional <email> element (Section 2.16)

   5.  One optional <uri> element (Section 2.44)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                   January 2014


   For instance:

   <annotation>
     Latest version available at <eref
     target='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml'/>.
   </annotation>

   ...will generate the text used in the reference for [XML].

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.33).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.47)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.17)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <const> elements (Section 2.11)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.15)

   o  <ital> elements (Section 2.23)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.21).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> is the only element in the vocabulary that provides full
   control of horizontal whitespace and line breaks, and thus is used
   for a variety of things, such as:

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                   January 2014


   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.  Note that RFCs occasionally are
   published with enhanced diagrams; a recent example is [RFC5598].

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.19).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                   January 2014


   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file essentially is in-lined.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.

   The value either is a well-known keyword (such as "abnf"), or an
   Internet Media Type (see [RFC2046]).

   How it is used depends on context and application.  For instance, a
   formatter can attempt to syntax-highlight code in certain known
   languages.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:space' attribute

   Determines whitespace handling.

   "preserve" is both the default value and the only meaningful setting
   anyway (because that's what the <artwork> element is for).

   See also Section 2.10 of [XML].

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see Section 4.9 of [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.21).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <organization> element (Section 2.28)

   2.  One optional <address> element (Section 2.2)

2.6.1.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.6.2.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                   January 2014


2.6.3.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.6.4.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.7.  <back>

   Contains the "back" part of the document: the references and
   appendices.

   This element appears as child element of: <rfc> (Section 2.36).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  Optional <references> elements (Section 2.34)

   2.  Optional <section> elements (Section 2.37)

2.8.  <c>

   Provides the content of a cell in a table.

   This element appears as child element of: <texttable> (Section 2.41).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.47)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.17)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.13)

   o  <const> elements (Section 2.11)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.15)

   o  <ital> elements (Section 2.23)

2.9.  <city>

   Gives the city name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.10.  <code>

   Gives the postal region code.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.11.  <const>

   Causes the text to be displayed in a constant-width font.

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.8), <postamble> (Section 2.31), <preamble>
   (Section 2.32), and <t> (Section 2.40).

   Content model: only text content.

2.12.  <country>

   Gives the country in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.30).

   Content model: only text content.

2.13.  <cref>

   Represents a comment.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work-in-progress.
   They usually appear either visually highlighted, at the end of the
   document (depending on file format and settings of the formatter), or
   not at all (when generating an RFC).

2.13.2.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.14.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see Section 8 of [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are
   left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system date
   if the attributes that are specified do match the system date.  Note
   that month names need to match the full (English) month name
   ("January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December") in order
   for expiration calculations to work.

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.21).

2.33.2.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.34.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative"; see item x

2.36.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   For Internet-Drafts, this specifies the draft name (which appears
   below the title).

   Note that the file extension is not part of the draft, so in general
   it should end with the current draft number ("-", plus two digits).

   Furthermore, it is good practice to disambiguate current editor
   copies from submitted drafts (for instance, by replacing the draft
   number with the string "latest").

   See Section 7 of [IDGUIDE] for further information.

2.45.1.  'blankLines' attribute

   [[element.vspace.attribute.blankLines.missing: attribute description

2.46.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group the document
   originates from, if any.  The recommended format is the official name
   of the Working Group (with some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.36.9).

2.47.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Unused.

   It's unclear what the purpose of this attribute is; processors seem
   to ignore it and it never was documented.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.47.3.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   [[element.xref.attribute.target.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   [[anchor5: Explain those code points where the processors implement
   something special, such as "nbsp".]]

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII
   [USASCII] characters (see Section 3.1 of [RFCSTYLE]).  Future
   versions are likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the
   vocabulary will be extended so that US-ACSII alternatives can be
   provided when that makes sense (for instance, in contact
   information).

5.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor6: This section is likely incomplete.]]

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document serves as the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml".  The following is to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for - surprise - "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
