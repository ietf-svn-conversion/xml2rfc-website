Writer Module
=============

Abstract
--------
The xml2rfc writer package contains a :ref:`base-writer` interface (an
abstract python class) with callback methods to write specific elements of an RFC 
document.  Adding a new output format to xml2rfc would be done by extending
this class.

Additionally, there is a collection of :ref:`formatted-writers` which provide
implementations for various formats.  Each writer takes an xmlrfc instance as
a constructor argument, and has a single public ``write()`` method which
converts and writes the rfc document to a specified filename.
