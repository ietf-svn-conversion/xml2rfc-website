1.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Since many of the definitions and syntax are identical to those for
   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616], this
   specification refers to the section where they are defined rather
   than copying it.  For brevity, [HX.Y] is to be taken to refer to
   Section X.Y of RFC 2616.

   All the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both
   prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF [RFC5234]).

   The complete message format in ABNF form is provided in [S.abnf] and
   is the normative format definition.  Note that productions may be
   duplicated within the main body of the document for reading
   convenience.  If a production in the body of the text conflicts with
   one in the normative definition, the latter rules.

1.1.  Definitions

   Media Resource 
                  An entity on the speech processing server that can be
                  controlled through MRCPv2.

   MRCP Server    
                  Aggregate of one or more "Media Resource" entities on
                  a server, exposed through MRCPv2.  Often, 'server' in
                  this document refers to an MRCP server.

   MRCP Client    
                  An entity controlling one or more Media Resources
                  through MRCPv2 ("Client" for short).

   DTMF           
                  Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency; a method of transmitting
                  key presses in-band, either as actual tones (Q.23
                  [Q.23]) or as named tone events (RFC 4733 [RFC4733]).

   Endpointing    
                  The process of automatically detecting the beginning
                  and end of speech in an audio stream.  This is
                  critical both for speech recognition and for automated
                  recording as one would find in voice mail systems.

   Hotword Mode   
                  A mode of speech recognition where a stream of
                  utterances is evaluated for match against a small set
                  of command words.  This is generally employed either
                  to trigger some action or to control the subsequent
                  grammar to be used for further recognition.

1.2.  State-Machine Diagrams

   The state-machine diagrams in this document do not show every
   possible method call.  Rather, they reflect the state of the resource
   based on the methods that have moved to IN-PROGRESS or COMPLETE
   states (see [sec.response]).  Note that since PENDING requests
   essentially have not affected the resource yet and are in the queue
   to be processed, they are not reflected in the state-machine
   diagrams.

1.3.  URI Schemes

   This document defines many protocol headers that contain URIs
   (Uniform Resource Identifiers [RFC3986]) or lists of URIs for
   referencing media.  The entire document, including the Security
   Considerations section (Section 12), assumes that HTTP or HTTP over
   TLS (HTTPS) [RFC2818] will be used as the URI addressing scheme
   unless otherwise stated.  However, implementations MAY support other
   schemes (such as 'file'), provided they have addressed any security
   considerations described in this document and any others particular
   to the specific scheme.  For example, implementations where the
   client and server both reside on the same physical hardware and the
   file system is secured by traditional file access controls on user-
   level could be reasonable candidates for supporting the 'file'
   scheme.
