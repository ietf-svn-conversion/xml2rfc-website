<h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Document Conventions</h1>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">RFC 2119</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2119]</cite>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Since many of the definitions and syntax are identical to those for the <a href="#RFC2616">Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2616]</cite>, this specification refers to the section where they are defined rather than copying it. For brevity, [HX.Y] is to be taken to refer to Section X.Y of RFC 2616.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">All the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (<a href="#RFC5234">ABNF</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5234]</cite>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The complete message format in ABNF form is provided in <a href="#S.abnf">[S.abnf]</a> and is the normative format definition. Note that productions may be duplicated within the main body of the document for reading convenience. If a production in the body of the text conflicts with one in the normative definition, the latter rules.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Definitions</h1>

<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>Media Resource</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/>An entity on the speech processing server that can be controlled through MRCPv2.</dd>
  <dt>MRCP Server</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/> Aggregate of one or more "Media Resource" entities on a server, exposed through MRCPv2.  Often, 'server' in this document refers to an MRCP server.</dd>
  <dt>MRCP Client</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/>An entity controlling one or more Media Resources through MRCPv2 ("Client" for short).</dd>
  <dt>DTMF</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/>Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency; a method of transmitting key presses in-band, either as actual tones (<a href="#Q.23">Q.23</a> <cite title="NONE">[Q.23]</cite>) or as named tone events (<a href="#RFC4733">RFC 4733</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4733]</cite>).</dd>
  <dt>Endpointing</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/>The process of automatically detecting the beginning and end of speech in an audio stream. This is critical both for speech recognition and for automated recording as one would find in voice mail systems.</dd>
  <dt>Hotword Mode</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 15"><br/>A mode of speech recognition where a stream of utterances is evaluated for match against a small set of command words. This is generally employed either to trigger some action or to control the subsequent grammar to be used for further recognition.</dd>

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> State-Machine Diagrams</h1>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">The state-machine diagrams in this document do not show every possible method call. Rather, they reflect the state of the resource based on the methods that have moved to IN-PROGRESS or COMPLETE states (see <a href="#sec.response">[sec.response]</a>). Note that since PENDING requests essentially have not affected the resource yet and are in the queue to be processed, they are not reflected in the state-machine diagrams.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> URI Schemes</h1>

<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">This document defines many protocol headers that contain URIs (<a href="#RFC3986">Uniform Resource Identifiers</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3986]</cite>) or lists of URIs for referencing media. The entire document, including the Security Considerations section (Section 12), assumes that HTTP or <a href="#RFC2818">HTTP over TLS (HTTPS)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2818]</cite> will be used as the URI addressing scheme unless otherwise stated. However, implementations MAY support other schemes (such as 'file'), provided they have addressed any security considerations described in this document and any others particular to the specific scheme. For example, implementations where the client and server both reside on the same physical hardware and the file system is secured by traditional file access controls on user-level could be reasonable candidates for supporting the 'file' scheme.</p>
