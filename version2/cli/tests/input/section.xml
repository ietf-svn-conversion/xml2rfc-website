    <section title="Document Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">
      RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>Since many of the definitions and syntax are identical to those for
      the <xref target="RFC2616">Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</xref>, this specification refers to the section where they
      are defined rather than copying it. For brevity, [HX.Y] is to be taken
      to refer to Section X.Y of RFC 2616.</t>

      <t>All the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both
      prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (<xref
      target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>).</t>

      <t>The complete message format in ABNF form is provided in <xref
      target="S.abnf"></xref> and is the normative format definition. Note
      that productions may be duplicated within the main body of the document
      for reading convenience. If a production in the body of the text
      conflicts with one in the normative definition, the latter rules.</t>

      <section title="Definitions">
        <t><list hangIndent="15" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Media Resource"><vspace blankLines="0" />An entity on
            the speech processing server that can be controlled through 
            MRCPv2.</t>

            <t hangText="MRCP Server"><vspace blankLines="0" />
Aggregate of one or more "Media Resource" entities on
                a server, exposed through MRCPv2.  Often, 'server' in 
                this document refers to an MRCP server.</t>

            <t hangText="MRCP Client"><vspace blankLines="0" />An entity
            controlling one or more Media Resources through MRCPv2
            ("Client" for short).</t>

            <t hangText="DTMF"><vspace blankLines="0" />Dual-Tone
            Multi-Frequency; a method of transmitting key presses in-band,
            either as actual tones (<xref target="Q.23">Q.23</xref>) or as
            named tone events (<xref target="RFC4733">RFC 4733</xref>).</t>

            <t hangText="Endpointing"><vspace blankLines="0" />The process of
            automatically detecting the beginning and end of speech in an
            audio stream. This is critical both for speech recognition and for
            automated recording as one would find in voice mail systems.</t>

            <t hangText="Hotword Mode"><vspace blankLines="0" />A mode of
            speech recognition where a stream of utterances is evaluated for
            match against a small set of command words. This is generally
            employed either to trigger some action or to control the
            subsequent grammar to be used for further recognition.</t>

      <section title="State-Machine Diagrams">
        <t>The state-machine diagrams in this document do not show every
        possible method call. Rather, they reflect the state of the resource
        based on the methods that have moved to IN-PROGRESS or COMPLETE states
        (see <xref target="sec.response"></xref>). Note that since PENDING
        requests essentially have not affected the resource yet and are in the
        queue to be processed, they are not reflected in the state-machine
        diagrams.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="URI Schemes">
        <t>This document defines many protocol headers that contain URIs
        (<xref target="RFC3986">Uniform Resource Identifiers</xref>) or
        lists of URIs for referencing media. The entire document, including
        the Security Considerations section (Section 12), assumes that HTTP or
        <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS (HTTPS)</xref> will be used as
        the URI addressing scheme unless otherwise stated. However,
        implementations MAY support other schemes (such as 'file'), provided
        they have addressed any security considerations described in this
        document and any others particular to the specific scheme. For
        example, implementations where the client and server both reside on
        the same physical hardware and the file system is secured by
        traditional file access controls on user-level could be reasonable
        candidates for supporting the 'file' scheme.</t>
