Have a section that is just examples of what is new in v3 (such as new table features)
	Want to add examples of <blockquote>
		Example of a cite for a reference that is already in the spec.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary. The examples cover both version 2
<xref target="XML2RFCv2"/> and version 3 <xref target="XML2RFCv3"/>. The purpose of this document
is to help developers of tools that process v2 and/or v3 documents to see examples of the documents.
</t>

<t>
Earlier versions of this document said that it was to help people with v2 documents transition to
v3. The authors have backed off from that goal. Instead, we point out that the changes from v2 to v3
are listed in detail in Section 1.2 of <xref target="XML2RFCv3"/>. Also, we expect that there
will be additional documents created later describing the v2-to-v3 conversion, as well as tools
that will do as much of the conversion as possible.
</t>

<t>
This is meant to be a short-lived document.
It is not expected that this document will be published as an RFC.
