Introduction
============

The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).

The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
submissions to the IETF.

Installation
============

Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
using appropriate switches and/or sudo.

However, in order to be able to generate PDF output, some external libraries
are needed, which you have to install separately as appropriate for your
platform.  For these, the platform-specific installations for WeasyPrint
(which xml2rfc uses to generate PDFs) apply:
https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html

For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
and install as appropriate for your platform.


Usage
=====

xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.

**Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``

Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
